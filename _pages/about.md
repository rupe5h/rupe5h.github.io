I am a Scientific Officer at Bhabha Atomic Research centre, working on design and construction of nuclear reprocessing plant.

Prior to this, I was a M. Tech. student in the Mechanical Engineering Department of Homi Bhabha National Institute. I worked with [Prof. M. K. Samal](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QRgDjXYAAAAJ) and [Dr. Kamal Sharma](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kamal-Sharma-5). In my master's thesis I developed a new method to evaluate stress-strain properties of material using FE analysis of ball indentation.
