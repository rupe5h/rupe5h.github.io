## About

I Joined [Bhabha Atomic Research Centre](https://www.barc.gov.in/) in 2017 as Trainee Scientific Officer. I completed one year Orientation Course for Engineering graduates and Science postgraduates(OCES) sucessfully. This course covered courses related to Nuclear Engineering and advanced courses in Mechanical Engineering.

After finishing The training program I worked on my Master's thesis under guidance of [Prof. M. K. Samal](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QRgDjXYAAAAJ) and [Dr. Kamal Sharma](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kamal-Sharma-5). I Developed a novel method to evaluate stress-strain properties of the material using the ball indentation data. After Finishing my Master's Thesis in 2019, I'm working on design and construction of Nuclear Reprocessing Facility at BARC, Tarapur.

I have qualified national-level competitive exam [GATE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduate_Aptitude_Test_in_Engineering) in Computer Science(2021) and  Mechanical Engineering(2017).


I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from [K J Somaiya College of Engineeing](https://kjsce.somaiya.edu/en) and Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering from [Homi bhabha National Institute](http://www.hbni.ac.in/).
