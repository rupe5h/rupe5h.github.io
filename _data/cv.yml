    - title: A new procedure to evaluate material stress-strain curve from ball indentation data
      institution: Dr. Kamal Sharma, Dr. M. K. Samal | BARC, Mumbai
      year: Aug 2018 - Jul 2019
      description:
        - Masters Thesis
        - Performed literature review on Ball Indentation Method. A method used for evaluating material stress strain properties. Identified gap area that the method in literatire depends on emperical material data.
        - Developed a new procedure based on Finite Element Analysis of Ball Indentation test considering Multi-axial state of stress present below the ball indentation area.
        - Designed and Fabricated the adapters to test the new method at room temperature and elevated temperature.
        - Tested new method sucessfully on SS304L and three other materials at room temperature with the error less than 5\%. Experiments at elevated temperatures were also carried out for SS304L upto 550\textdegreeC and for Inconel 690 upto 800\textdegreeC.
        - Effect of different Ball Diameter was studied using FE analysis.
    
    - title: Transient Thermomechanical FE analysis of Induction melter.
